# Welcome to the Web Scraping Repository! 🌐✨

This repository is your one-stop-shop for scripts that make web scraping a breeze! Originally created to simplify adding products to Shopify directly from various websites, this collection of scripts is here to help you get things done efficiently (and with a sprinkle of generative AI magic 🤖✨).

---

## What's Inside? 🛠️
You'll find folders containing scripts for different e-shops, each tailored to scrape product data and save it into a Shopify-compatible format.

Each script is accompanied by its own README.md file with (kind of) helpful instructions. 😅

## Why Was This Created? 🤷
We were tired of manually adding products to Shopify. Web scraping seemed like a smart shortcut, and voila! Here we are. That said:
- 🚫 **Don’t use these scripts without the store owner’s permission!**
- 🙏 We mean it: get permission before scraping any website.

## A Few Things You Should Know ⚠️
- **The Documentation**: Uh, let’s just say it’s *minimalistic*. 🫣 But don’t worry! If you’ve got some basic Python skills, you’ll get the hang of it.
- **Modifications Required**: Each script is customized for specific stores. You’ll need to tweak stuff like URLs, tags, or HTML selectors to make them work for other websites.
- **Generative AI Involved**: Some of the code (and even this README!) was crafted with the help of generative AI. Fancy, right? But don’t worry, it’s fully tested and works as intended (most of the time).

## How to Get Started 🚀
1. **Pick a Folder**: Each folder corresponds to a different store.
2. **Check the README.md Inside**: Every folder has its own readme file with instructions specific to that script.
3. **Install Python Requirements**: Make sure you’ve got the necessary libraries (check `requirements.txt`).
4. **Tinker Around**: Update the script with the correct URLs and tags for your target website.
5. **Run the Script**: Generate your Shopify-ready CSV files and make your life easier.

## A Final Note 🌟
This repository was built with a lot of late-night coding and caffeine. ☕ It’s not perfect, but it gets the job done. Have fun, learn something new, and remember: **always scrape responsibly!** 🚀

Stay awesome,
